      <h2 class="htwo" style="text-align: center;"> So... More About My Summer... <br></h2>
      <p class="pone">In late June, I went to Mexico with my family! I visited one of the new 7 world wonders (Chichen
        Itza) and
        learned
        a lot about Mexico’s past and even saw their pyramids! I also enjoyed the authentic Mexican food that I had
        everyday
        and the warm beaches that they had to offer. Even though I wasn’t home, I got to celebrate the Fourth of July
        with
        my family! When I came back to America, the fun didn’t stop. I came home on the 6th and my Birthday was on the
        8th.
        I celebrated my birthday with a Tres Leches cake and dinner at a restaurant called “The Block”. A little after
        my
        birthday some of my family came over to celebrate it with me in my backyard by barbecuing burgers and swimming
        in
        the pool. In the middle of July, my aunt from Mexico came to America and we showed her all that New Jersey had
        to
        offer. We took her to Asbury and Belmar and even took her to a Rainforest Cafe dinner. When she left it was the
        start of August. We hit August off with a couple of small 1 day trips. Whether it would be an arcade trip out on
        IPlayAmerica or a thrill seeking day at Six Flags Great Adventure, or even a long beautiful day at the park, I
        spent
        the better part of August enjoying myself! Late Summer I went to Hershey Park and it was wonderful. From the
        thrill
        seeking Skyrush roller coaster to the bucket of chocolate chip cookies, I will definitely be visiting again in
        the
        future. The last day of Summer break I spent my time at my cousin's house, playing volleyball and eating ice
        cream.
        It was a good way to end off Summer break. Throughout the whole Summer I've been focussing on myself, working
        out
        6
        times a week and playing basketball daily. I also have been eating healthier on a day to day basis, trying to
        eat
        more protein dense foods. While I can’t record every single moment of my summer, here are my highlights of the
        season!

    <h1 class="hthree">My Goals!
      <br>

      <p class="ptwo">I have a couple of goals for this year. To start I am trying to gain 10 lbs by the end of the
        year. I want to do this so I have more power in basketball and so I can drive easier. Another goal I have for
        the year is to do well in all my classes. I know everyone else has this goal but I heard this year is important
        to do good. Another goal I have is to really figure out what I want to do when I’m older. I am still deciding on
        what I want to do, but this year I really want to narrow it down. Yet another goal I have is to do good on the
        SAT. I do 20 SAT practice problems everyday. I would also like to try to start a small side project, either like
        a YouTube channel or maybe even making small websites. Here are some of the goals I have for the 2022 and 2023
        year, and hopefully I get them done!
